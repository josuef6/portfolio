					<p>In March 2018 I have the priviledge of traveling to the United Kingdom where I was presenting a research paper in
						Sheffield, England.
						During my time in Sheffield I had the chance to explore the city and enjoy the beautiful scenery. There were
						plenty
						of places to take
						walks or hikes. I was fortunate to have many friends who attended the conference as well so we were able to go
						out
						and explore just about
						every night we were there.
					</p>
					<p>After the conference was over, I traveled to London where there were endless places to site see. My favorite part
						about getting around in
						the city was taking the "tube" or subway system. I got in the habit of getting lost with my friends in the city
						just
						so we can have an excuse
						to visit as many places as we good and go the the variety of restaurants located in the city.
					</p>
					<p>Perhaps on of the more memorable things I did while in England was attend a football (soccer) match in
						Manchester. I
						just starting to get back
						into the sport and knew how big soccer was in the UK. Lucky for me, I was flying out of Manchester and found out
						there was a match being played
						in the city the day before I left so I was able to attend a Manchester United game!
