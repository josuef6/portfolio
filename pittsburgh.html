				<p>For the couple ofsummers I have had the opportunity to spend time in the city of Pittsburgh!
					This amazing city is home to beautiful scenery, great food, and fantastic people. I made some
					amazing lifelong friends that I still keep in touch with who have supported me and were a major
					influence in getting me to where I am today. Pittsburgh has become one of if not my favorite city
					to visit.

					<p><br>
						This was my first time in the city of Pittsburgh and I fell in love with the city! I participated in a 18+ month
						research program that opened so many opportunities for me within the field of information. During my time in
						Pittsburgh I attended my first professional baseball games.

						One of those opportunities led me back to Pittsburgh as I spent 8-weeks at Carnegie Mellon's
						<a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/itlab/"> IT Lab: Summer Security Intensive (SSI)</a> program. I was also
						wrapping up some preliminary work for my research project that I started the year before.
